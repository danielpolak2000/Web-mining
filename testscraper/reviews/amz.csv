My phone vibrates so bad in my hand by using this case, something about the design of either the phone or the case just makes it so unusable in my opinion.I am missing my pixel 4 xl already. Didn't have any issues with that 1. I guess I'll wait until the 6 comes out.I don't recommend this case based on the audio issue I am having. It feels like the audio is being muffled or blocked somehow.

I have been using Spigen cases for what seems like a decade at this point - or somewhere close to it - and I've never had one that was a sloppy fit like this one.  It may be the complex geometry, but the top and bottom of the case bulge out like they are not properly formed, or perhaps not deep enough to stay taught.  I'm concerned that the play in the case might result in it catching on things and getting worse.  It pains me to have to ding the company, but this won't suffice, I'm afraid.

I've had multiple Spigen cases for multiple phones and I've been happy with them so far. This one fits well and feels like a good case. Unfortunately there is a speaker cutout for a speaker that does not exist on the phone. Since the edges of the phone are symmetrical this really destroys the sleek look. It is also perfectly shaped to collect a lot of dust. Would have given 5 stars without the cutout.

Overall the case is fine. It is sturdy, easy to grip, and there are no issues with using the fingerprint reader.The big issue I have is the bezel around the front edge of the case is too tall. Given that the Pixel 5 relies solely on gesture navigation to go back, and switch apps, this is problematic. It's sometimes difficult to get your thumb all the way to the edge of the screen to trigger the gesture. It's not impossible to get the gestures to work, but very often I find myself having to repeat a gesture because the case got in the way.

Spigen makes quality cases and this one is no exception. It's thin which is what I love about this case. However, the front edges are too thick and high. This means swiping from any of the 4 edges is very hard. It takes a few tries to get it to work. Works great without the case so I know its the limitation with the case. This also makes using gestures entirely impossible since google relies on swiping from the bottom, left and right edges.For protection this is great but not for usability. Will be returning

The case is OK, I bought this as an alternative to the fabric Google Pixel 5 case.  I like the textured feel at the back, it doesn't feel like it will slip in your hands.  However, (i) it does have the notch for the speaker, which I don't think is needed and (ii) the front edges feel a little too raised, this might have the advantage of protecting the screen a little more, but I am quite aware of them when holding the phone.  I'll keep it as a backup case.

First off, I was very hesitant to purchase this case because of some of the ""bad"" reviews. But I decided to take a chance. I'm happy to say that upon receiving the product, I realized a lot of the bad things said about this case were people just nitpicking because of personal preferences. Anyways here we go:Likes:* Precise cutouts* Came in neatly packaged with no damage whatsoever, like what other people say.* Very good quality for the price.* Fits the pixel 5 nicely snug enough but will not damage/scratch your phone when installing like other cases.* Great screen and camera protection* Looks nice* Good protection without adding too much bulk. Slim is without giving up good protection.Dislike:* Only comes in black, wished there were more color choices.* More plastic than I thought it would be. So it's not as ""grippy"" as it looks on pictures, but the texture on the sides of the case help quite a bit.So if you're looking for slim but good protection and some decent grip then this case might just be for you. But if you need extra protection and better grip and do not mind the bulky cases then look elsewhere.

Got the phone with very few scratches on screen, I'm happy with the phone. 4 stars- Looks new, with a great battery, last me all day because of pixels innovative system. Its a fast and reliable phone. I can tell the screen was replaced as expected with a refurbished product, because screen is a little glitchy. . and shows random colors when on an all black screen. either than that... All i can do is Just hope yall used a good quality replacement screen to last me. So expect a phone with an okay screen replacement.

I suspect the device here is limited for use, at least in its Pixel 5 form as that smartphone has had smallish numbers in circulation.  To the extent that the review is able to generalize to other models, the case appears fashionable, hard to damage and reasonable for protection of the phone.  The front area about the phone's bevel or equivalent has a raised margin that protects the screen a bit should the device fall face down.  It has easy traction so that it is not easy to drop from a poor grip.  It holds its color well and does not show wear or tarnish.  It should remain serviceable for a good while.

I bought two cases since my wife and I just upgraded to Pixel 5's, the Spigen Liquid Armor and the Spigen Thin Fit cases. My wife's came in first, and so did the thin fit, so I let her use it since she needed it right away.I have extremely dry hands, thus grip is a really important feature for me. The thin fit case wins hands-down on grip. This case was okay when it came to grip, but I would highly recommend looking towards this thin fit case if that's an issue for you.Other than that, both of the cases seem to have the same thickness and protection. They both have a bevel above the screen to protect the screen and I feel like they would do about the same in a drop test.

This is everything you'd expect from a Spigen phone case with 1 major problem that the rest may have already mentioned. The case does have a top cutout for a non existent top speaker. Aesthetically it doesn't make sense or look that nice, but it won't affect it's function in anyway. So if you're looking for a review for the case it self, it provides great protection at an affordable price, but it's not as accurate as what they're known for. I'd give it a 3.5/5 if I could because an error like this for such a phone should not have been missed out. I do hope they fix that problem in the second batch of cases but we'll have to wait and see.

Much better than the kwmobile brand I also bought.  That one has an uncomfortable molding seam right where you hold the phone.  This one at least has textured edges to improve grip where you need it.  I'm still jealous of my wife's iPhone case, which has the best grippy surface I've ever held.  I'm puzzled why I can't find the same material in an Android case.

For the price, this case is unbeatable. I particularly love the simplocity and the ridged edges. This gives a great trip when holding the phone by the sides. However, the diamond pattern on the back seems to have the opposite effect. If I am simply resting my phone in one hand, perhaps not by holding by 'sides' of the phone, it feels less secure and is easier to slip around. I've actually dropped my phone a couple of times because of this. Regardless, it's a well built case and has protected my phone exactly like it should.

Fits well. Buttons are raised and easy to feal for without looking. Holes line up. Seems to have just enough protection for an accidental drop without being to bulky. The pictures don't make it look matte black but it is. Sides and back are textured for grip. Despite being matte, finger prints show on the back, but not as bad as the non-textured or glossy cases. Feels good in the hand. It is a little boring looking, but overall I like it, especially for the price. If you are not looking for something fancy, but fits well and should protect from a drop (I have not dropped it yet to test), this may be the case for you.

This case fits well, was easy to get the phone to snap into the case, all the port cutouts line up perfectly. It has a nice feel when holding the phone, seems durable (as in it doesn't feel like the plastic is going to crack every time I take the pone in or out). The button keys are perfectly aligned and allow for unobstructed access to volume and power buttons with a normal amount of pressure applied. It's just the right fit coupled with the spigen glass screen protector to cover nearly all the screen but not rub against the edge of the screen protector causing the edges to chip, fray or come up.  The fingerprint reader cutout is perfect, very easy to use biometrics to unlock the phone. I am having no trouble with wireless charging with the case on, and I have used three separate wireless chargers (all 15-18w)

This is a great case if you are someone who wants a case that is slim but durable! Fits very nicely in my pockets and doesn't bother me when walking around, and doing casual activities. The case is more sturdy and alittle thicker than I had thought, which is nice. The millimeters of added height on the case to protect the screen, and back camera has stopped my phone from damage so many times when my phone is leaning against something and falls flat forward or backwards. So I appreciate that feature!The grip of the case is decent enough, but I wouldn't say it is the best. The side of the case has alot of little slits that allow you to grip the phone better, and does help with grip. I am not a fan of it, but it does do the job good enough so I'm not complaining :)Overall, this is a great case for an awesome price! Highly recommend!

Had a Spigen case for my Pixel 3.  So a natural choice (though I got a different model - for no particular reason) for my Pixel 5.  It's getting so hard to find a phone that fits in your pocket and hand - the Pixel 6s were coming and my Pixel 3 was getting old, but when I saw how HUGE those are going to be, got myself a Pixel 5 before they disappear.  Of course the case adds a little bit of size and weight, but no more than with the Pixel 3.The case fits perfectly, snugly, no gaps around the camera window or fingerprint sensor, USB port or bottom speakers, etc.  And the buttons line up perfectly and might add a smidgen (spigon lol get it) of added protection from dust or moisture.And the price point is perfect as well.

This Spigen Liquid Air Armor turned out to be exactly what I needed for my Pixel 5. Most stores didn't have Pixel 5 cases so I ordered this one. Just grippy enough that it won't slip out of your hand but not so rubbery so it will slide in and out of your pockets without grabbing. It makes the side buttons easier to feel and use and the bumper around the outside provides corner protection and keeps my finger or thumb from accidentally touching the edge of the touch screen while holding. The rear fingerprint hole allows me to find and use the reader with ease. It is thin enough on the back that I have no problem charging it on the various wireless chargers that I have. I would say this is a great case for those that don't want to change the size & feel of their Pixel much but want some protection and grip.

I have small hands with thick fingers, so I wanted a phone case that was sturdy, but didn't feel too bulky. This definitely met my requirements. It has a textured back so it's easy to grip. But sometimes dust can get trapped in the little crevices of the texture. It's easy to clean so it's not really a problem. I accidentally dropped my phone on the concrete sidewalk and it landed face down. It was completely fine. Only small complaint is that I wish it came in different colors. 2 thumbs up, definitely worth the money.

Received it today.Just like the Ultra Hybrid for the Pixel 5 that I also ordered, this case has a cutout on the front-top for a speaker grill that's supposedly in the top bezel of the phone.  The problem is that this phone has no speaker grill at the top of the Pixel 5.  The pictures used here are even wrong.  The speaker for the Pixel 5 is underneath the top portion of the screen.The problem is that with this unnecessary cutout, it's just another place for dust and dirt to get in and scratch the phone.
